    "We shall cover the basics of using qutip to study different optical states and for studying the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. Of course numerical methods are roughly the same whatever tool you use, but for Python we have our disposal quite a few ready made packages for quantum optics and/or quantum information calculations such as QuTiP (http://qutip.org/) and Qiskit (https://qiskit.org/). Qiskit is more focussed on quantum computing algorithms where as qutip is more a \"general purpose\" toolbox for quantum system modelling, including optical states and Jaynes-Cummings model."
